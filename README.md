## About This Repository

I set up this repository to create a professional portfolio website. It includes my work history, professional achievements, and examples of my writing and data analysis skills.

The website design is based on Cayman, a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages, and uses SCSS. You can find the original repository of the Cayman theme [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
